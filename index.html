  <p>This is the background image I created using Tilemap.</p>
  <img src="./img/screenshots1.png" width = "480" height = "315">
  <p>But I forgot to record my progress from the start, but this screenshot is where I created collision blocks using a series of arrays generated by Tilemap.</p>
  <img src="./img/screenshots2.png" width = "480" height = "315">
  <p>The red box are the collision boxes. And the solid red box is the player I created. Look at it now, it is in the collision box since I had not add code of the actual collision,</p>
  <img src="./img/screenshots3.png" width = "480" height = "315">
  <p>And in this screenshot, I had successfully added collisions to the player. Look at it now, it had successfully place at the platform.</p>
  <img src="./img/screenshots4.png" width = "480" height = "315">
  <p>And in this screenshot, I had made the collision box transprant.<p>
  <p>Some example screenshots of my code.<p>

  <img src="./img/code2.png" width = "480" height = "315">
  <img src="./img/code3.png" width = "480" height = "315">
  <p>And here is where you can look at the source of my code. And I comment on my code so that people can understand what the code does better.<p>
